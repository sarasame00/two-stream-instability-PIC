# Two-stream instability simulation (PIC Method)

This project simulates the **two-stream instability** in a cold plasma using the **Particle-In-Cell (PIC)** method. It includes both 1D and 2D implementations in C, with Python scripts for post-processing and visualization.

## About

Two counter-streaming electron beams interact through self-consistent electric fields, generating electrostatic instabilities. This project models the resulting dynamics using:

- 1D and 2D PIC simulations
- Leap-frog (1D) and Boris (2D) integration methods
- Gauss-Seidel solver for the Poisson equation
- Cloud-In-Cell interpolation
